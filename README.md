# Project

## Welcome to Microsoft Purview Advanced Rich Reports (MPARR) Collector.

Having the right information at the right time has great business value, especially in the context of implementing security and compliance measures.  It's crucial to recognize that achieving this goal is a strategic business objective. Generating user-friendly reports to monitor end users' utilization and adoption is a valuable global asset.  This solution leverages data from Microsoft 365 services, empowering different business units to access relevant information. C-level executives can utilize this solution to gain insights into compliance-related business metrics.

<p align="center">Current Architecture for MPARR</p>

Today one of the principal challenges in all organizations is stay align with the Compliance principles, each organization define their own priorities, and policies definitions. But, in all the cases they need to involve the complete organization, and to involve we need to show the right information at the right time.
Office 365 Management API collect all the information available through Unified Auditing tool, this helps to Security, Compliance and IT areas looking for some specific information and generate some reports but is not possible easily to show that information to different business units, and they donâ€™t have the time neither to prepare more detailed reports.

<p align="center">Variables needed to set in laconfig.json files and the TableNames created on Logs Analytics</p>
 
In that order of ideas, the solution presented next permit to have a robust solution to collect all the data and prepare reports with specific scopes to specific audiences, without require special permissions or additional knowledge to understand the security tools.
This solution collects all the information available through Office 365 Management API and store this information on Logs Analytics workspace, this one can be the same used for Sentinel (we will discuss more this point next), from this workspace the information can be consumed using Power BI desktop to create advanced rich reports to publish then with Power BI online workspaces, this step permit to generate different workspaces for different audiences. To give more added value to these reports, some additional scrips are delivered, to collect as example the data related to Azure AD attributes, this one permit to create reports based on location, country, business units and any other Azure AD attribute available.

<p align="center">TableNames created on Logs Analytics and use</p>
 
As we said previously, because this information can be stored on the same workspace used for Sentinel, this information can be utilized to generate workbooks with more detailed information for Security monitoring.
In this article, we will see how we can implement this script to start collecting the information and consume that information.

Some Power BI reports that can be created:
